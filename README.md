# ML and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository for my Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects. This repository showcases various ML and DL implementations using popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, and NVIDIA's cuDNN library.

## Projects

### 1. Object Detection and Tracking

- **Description**: Implemented real-time object detection and tracking using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and NVIDIA's DNN library with CUDA and cuDNN. This project involves detecting and tracking objects in real-time video feeds.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy rate of 90% in real-time object detection on a diverse dataset.
- **Technologies Used**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, CUDA, cuDNN
- **Demo**: [Link to demo or screenshots]

### 2. Handwritten Digit Recognition

- **Description**: Developed a high-accuracy handwritten digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset. This model classifies handwritten digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved a classification accuracy of 98.7% on the test dataset.
- **Technologies Used**: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy
- **Demo**: [Link to demo or screenshots]

## Getting Started

To run these projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ymadhumohanreddy/ML-and-DL-projects.git
    cd ML-and-DL-projects
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required packages using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the projects**:
    Navigate to the project directory and execute the scripts as follows:
    ```bash
    python object_detection_tracking.py
    python handwritten_digit_recognition.py
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- NVIDIA's cuDNN library (for CUDA-enabled operations)
